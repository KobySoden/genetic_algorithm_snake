# genetic_algorithm_snake

This project is a game of snake that uses a Neural Network to predict the movement of the snake based on a view of the screen. 
The program randomly initializes the wieghts/biases of a starting population of nueral networks then the genetic algorithm chooses
top performing Neural Networks to breed. Better performing NN's have a much higher chance to breed but a few NN's are chosen randomly to breed. 
Additionally there is a chance for each weight/bias to mutate after being bred.
